Hello, world!

I'm Robert Wagner, and this is a test repository made for the GitHub tutorial.  My day job is as a researcher on the [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera][lroc], where I do miscellaneous image processing and analysis using command-line tools. Projects here are likely to be mostly in Python, with a side-helping of Bash, and possibly some C if I'm feeling like torturing myself.
